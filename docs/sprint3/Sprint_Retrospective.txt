                                    SPRINT 3 RETROSPECTIVE
=========================================================

Sprint: 3
Sprint end date: 2025-12-13
Retrospective prepared: 2025-12-13

**Sprint Goal**
- Complete remaining user stories for each member (stories 7 and 8), improve test coverage, and prepare research documentation for symbolic and concolic testing approaches.

**What Went Well**
- **Completed Stories by Member**:
  - Abhiram: Completed user stories #7 (TSK-002 – Mark Task Complete) and #8 (PRJ-003 – Save/Load Project Data) with good cyclomatic complexity and safe persistence mechanisms.
  - Charan: Completed user stories #7 and #8 related to sprint management enhancements and velocity tracking improvements.
  - Roshan: Completed user stories #7 (SYM-001 – Symbolic Execution testing demo) and #8 (CON-001 – Concolic Testing harness) with self-contained test implementations.

- **Research and Documentation**: The team invested time in researching symbolic execution and concolic testing approaches. Demo implementations were added to the test suite showing path exploration and defect discovery capabilities.

- **Code Quality Improvements**: Added docstrings, input validation, and atomic file operations across multiple modules. Backup and restore functionality implemented for project data persistence.

**What Didn't Go Well**
- **Delayed Deliverables from Roshan**: PERT chart generation and COCOMO estimation modules (MET-001, MET-002, MET-003) originally planned for Sprint 1 remain incomplete. These deliverables were delayed due to:
  - Time allocation issues and competing priorities with symbolic/concolic research.
  - Insufficient baseline data for realistic COCOMO calibration.
  - Delayed coordination on metrics module integration with the main project manager.

- **GitHub Upload Blocked**: Because PERT and COCOMO modules are incomplete, the team could not upload the full metrics package to GitHub as planned. This blocks integration and review by stakeholders.

- **Story #9 Deferred**: Each member's 9th user story was deferred to Sprint 4 (the final sprint) to allow time for documentation, testing, and addressing the PERT/COCOMO gap.

**Root Causes / Observations**
- Roshan underestimated the complexity of implementing realistic PERT and COCOMO functions; these require domain knowledge and calibration that was not available early in the sprint.
- The team prioritized symbolic/concolic research over completing Sprint 1 carryover tasks, which caused a backlog bottleneck.
- Communication gaps between Roshan and other team members delayed the handoff of required inputs (e.g., task estimates, historical project data) for metrics calculations.

**Action Items (Concrete, Owner, Due Date)**
1. **Complete PERT and COCOMO Modules** — Owner: Roshan — Due: 2025-12-20
   - Implement `calculate_pert`, `cocomo_basic`, and `cocomo_intermediate` functions with docstrings and unit tests.
   - Use simplified assumptions and document calibration parameters clearly.
   - Add test cases with known inputs/outputs to validate correctness.

2. **Upload Metrics Module to GitHub** — Owner: Roshan — Due: 2025-12-21
   - Once PERT/COCOMO are complete, create a feature branch `feature/MET-001-002-003-metrics` and push.
   - Open a PR with summary of changes and link to user stories MET-001, MET-002, MET-003.

3. **Coordinate on Sprint 4 Planning** — Owner: All members — Due: 2025-12-16
   - Review deferred story #9 for each member and finalize Sprint 4 backlog.
   - Allocate time for integration testing and final documentation.

4. **Add Integration Tests for Persistence** — Owner: Abhiram — Due: 2025-12-18
   - Add tests covering `save_project_data` backup creation and `load_project_data` restore scenarios.
   - Validate atomic write behavior and backup file cleanup.

5. **Document Symbolic/Concolic Research Findings** — Owner: Roshan — Due: 2025-12-17
   - Create a brief research summary document (`docs/research/symbolic_concolic_notes.md`) describing approaches, trade-offs, and future directions.
   - Link the demo test implementations (`test_sym_001`, `test_con_001`) in the document.

6. **Stabilize CI and Enable Coverage Enforcement** — Owner: Abhiram — Due: 2025-12-19
   - Finalize GitHub Actions workflow to block PRs with coverage < 85%.
   - Add radon CC check and fail builds on violations.

**Quality Gates (Sprint 4 prerequisites)**
- All deferred stories (#9 for each member) must include tests and maintain coverage >= 85%.
- PERT and COCOMO modules must be merged and passing CI before Sprint 4 ends.
- All feature branches must be reviewed and merged to `development` before final release.

**Follow-up / Backlog Items**
- Create `docs/research/symbolic_concolic_notes.md` summarizing research findings — Owner: Roshan — Due: 2025-12-17
- Add historical velocity tracking to the sprint manager — Owner: Charan — Due: 2026-01-10
- Implement `test_registry` module for cataloging test outcomes — Owner: Roshan — Due: 2026-01-15

**Final Notes**
- Sprint 3 achieved significant progress on core functionality (task completion, persistence, symbolic/concolic demos) but revealed a critical gap in metrics module completion. The team must prioritize Roshan's PERT/COCOMO work in parallel with Sprint 4 story #9 implementations to ensure the project is complete and ready for final delivery.

- The research into symbolic and concolic testing was valuable and positions the team well for future advanced testing features, but it must not come at the expense of core deliverables.
