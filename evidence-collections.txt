🟩 BEFORE SPRINT 1 (Sprint 0 Completion Evidence)

Sprint 0 is planning only, no actual coding.

You must have the following completed in the repo before starting Sprint 1:

✅ 1. User Stories Evidence

Required files:

/docs/sprint0/user_stories.txt

/docs/sprint0/userstories_list.png → Screenshot of all 27 GitHub issues

The marker checks:
✔ All stories listed
✔ Stories split among 3 members
✔ Foundational planning complete

✅ 2. Planning Poker Evidence

This is mandatory for LO2.

Required:

/docs/sprint0/planning_poker.png

The marker checks:
✔ Story points assigned
✔ Collaborative estimation
✔ Photos/screenshots of tool

✅ 3. Project Board Setup (Backlog Evidence)

Screenshots needed:

/docs/sprint0/project_board_backlog.png

/docs/sprint0/sprint_assignments.png

/docs/sprint0/team_capacity_setup.png

Must show:
✔ All issues imported into board
✔ Issues distributed correctly to each sprint
✔ Deadline timeline visible
✔ Assigned owners per story
✔ Story points visible

✅ 4. Branching Strategy & Repository Structure

Files:

/docs/sprint0/branch_strategy.png

/docs/sprint0/repo_structure.png

Must show:
✔ main / dev / story/* branches
✔ branch protection
✔ planned workflow

✅ 5. CMMI Level 2 Skeleton

File:

/docs/CMMI_Level2.md

Should show Sprint 0 planning under:

Requirements Management

Project Planning

Monitoring & Control

Configuration Management

🟩 If you complete all items above, Sprint 0 → 100% marks.
🟦 DURING SPRINT 1 (Active Development Evidence)

Sprint 1 is where real development begins.

The examiners want traceability and team process.

You must collect 3 categories of evidence during development:

🔵 1. Story-Based Branching

For each Sprint 1 story:

Create a branch:
story/PRJ-00X-feature-name

Commit work to that branch

Write meaningful commit messages

Evidence:

/docs/sprint1/branches_in_use.png

🔵 2. Pull Requests (PRs) with Peer Review

This is critical for marks.

Every PR must include:
✔ Meaningful title — e.g., “Implement PRJ-001 Create Project Functionality”
✔ Link to issue — e.g., Fixes #14
✔ Screenshots (if applicable)
✔ 1 peer review comment
✔ Reviewer approval

Evidence (for each PR):

/docs/sprint1/pr1.png

/docs/sprint1/pr2.png

etc.

Markers check PR review quality, so ensure:

Feedback comments

Approvals

Discussions

🔵 3. Development Progress Tracking

Update your project board LIVE.

Required:

Move issues from Sprint 1 → In Progress → Done

Drag PRs into board columns

Evidence screenshots:

/docs/sprint1/board_end_sprint.png (finished)

🟥 AFTER SPRINT 1 (Completion Evidence)

This is the part most students miss — and they lose marks.

You must document sprint completion with:

🔴 1. Burndown Chart Evidence

You MUST produce a burndown chart for Sprint 1.

Even a simple chart made in Excel/Google Sheets counts.

Evidence:

/docs/sprint1/burndown_sprint1.png

🔴 2. Sprint Retrospective

Add a dedicated file:

/docs/sprint1/retrospective.md

Contents:

## What went well
- Team completed 9 stories within capacity.
- PR reviews improved code quality.

## What didn’t go well
- Story point estimation was slightly inaccurate.
- Branch conflicts occurred early.

## Action points for Sprint 2
- Improve review scheduling.
- Introduce automated tests earlier.

🔴 3. CMMI Level 2 Sprint 1 Additions

Update:

/docs/CMMI_Level2.md

Add Sprint 1 details under:

Project Monitoring & Control

QA

Configuration Management

🔴 4. Tag the Sprint

Use:

git tag -a sprint1 -m "Sprint 1 Completed"
git push origin sprint1


This is mandatory for Agile grading.

💯 FINAL SUMMARY (PRINT THIS OUT)
BEFORE SPRINT 1
MUST HAVE:

✔ User stories list
✔ Issues created
✔ Planning Poker
✔ Sprints assigned
✔ Branch strategy
✔ CMMI skeleton
✔ Repo structure screenshot

DURING SPRINT 1
MUST DO:

✔ Branch per story
✔ PRs per story
✔ Peer review on PRs
✔ Progress on project board
✔ Commit history per story

AFTER SPRINT 1
MUST CAPTURE:

✔ Burndown chart
✔ Sprint retrospective
✔ CMMI Level 2 updated
✔ Tagged release (sprint1)
